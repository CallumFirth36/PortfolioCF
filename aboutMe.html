            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <P>
                My name if Callum Firth and I am nineteen years old. I am currently studying Computer Science at the University of Dundee. I first got interested with in
                programming when I took a college course during my 4th year of academy. It quickly grew
                into an obsession, and I was delighted to be accepted to study Computer Science. 
            </P>
            <br>
            <p>
                During my time learning, I have completed many projects, including working with a team to
                make a web portal for an architectural company, various applications and games with Java, this
                portfolio website, and more.

            <h2>Interests</h2>
            <h3>Music</h3>
            <P>
                Music has been a huge part of my life ever since I started
                learning the guitar and piano. I love to compose my own music
                and study the techniques used by my idols. Music is a great outlet for my creativity.

            </P>
            <h3>Sport</h3>
            <p>
                I like to keep active. I am member of the badminton social club at university. I am also keen
                on running, football and cycling.
